The purpose of a DataSource plugin is to provide a mechanism by which molten can access data about and acquire "actions" against a particular type of object.

Data Sources themselves are a @leverege/ui-attributes concept, and more information can be found about them <a href="https://bitbucket.org/leverege/ui-attributes/src/development/src/dataSource/" target="_blank">here</a>

An example of a fleshed out DataSource class can be found at `src/blueprints/dataSource/BlueprintDataSource.js` or `demo/pets/dataSource/PetDataSource.js`
